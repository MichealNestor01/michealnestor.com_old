# michealnestor.com
MichealNestor.com is my personal website. It was originally built from a course at https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-html5-css3-course this course taught me html and css from scratch and this website is the result. 

The landing/home page and the contact page are the direct result of me following the tutorial, though I have made a lot of personal design choices and it is far from a carbon copy of the tutorial.

The contact page apart from personal design choices is very similar, to the course's though due to the simplistic nature of the page this is unsurprising.

The projects page is almost entirely original, I am very proud of the projects gallery, it uses java script to switch between projects displaying a picture and a short description of each, I am proud of how easy it is for me to add another project, as the javascript only needs me to update an array by adding a single object, and then it works.
