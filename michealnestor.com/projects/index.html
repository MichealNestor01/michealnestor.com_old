              <p class='paragraph'>
                This is a python project that takes data from yahoo finance and plots the price history of certain stocks,
                I built it to practice GUI design with PyQt5, webscraping with BeautifulSoup4, and graphs with matplotlib.
                I am pleased with the result as the main goal was learning how to link PyQt5 and Matplotlib, which was a success!

              <p class='paragraph'>
                I created this calculator to learn and practice the python PyQt5 module. It is a module for creating graphical 
                user interfaces in python, I used the program Qt Designer to create the interface, and then I converted the interface
                file into a python file, and then coded the functionality of the LCD's and buttons.

              <p class='paragraph'>    
                This website was my first non-python project, it has allowed me to learn HTML, CSS/SAS and small amounts of JavaScript.
                It was unusual project for me because there was a much larger emphasis on design as the code was relatively simple. I am 
                most proud of this project gallery and the script behind it, as well as the responsive nature of the website, delivering a 
                good user experience across all screen sizes.
